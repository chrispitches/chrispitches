- 👋 Hi, I’m @chrispitches, aka Chris Hamann
- 👀 I’m interested in learning more about creating my own programs and software, and learning and furthering my understanding of what I am capable of.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the software R, but would like to learn SQL or Tableau next at least in some capacity.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that I can learn to help pivot into something meaningful.
- 📫 How to reach me...via email or messages here: hamannchristopher9@gmail.com
